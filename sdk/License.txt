provided subject to the MIT license, unless otherwise noted in the license,
notice or readme files distributed with the example or in related
documentation. The SDK may otherwise include software or other
materials that are provided under a separate license agreement, and
that separate license will govern the use of such software or other
materials in the event of a conflict with this Agreement. Any such
separate license agreement may be indicated in the license, notice, or
readme files distributed with the applicable software or other
materials or in related documentation.

4. No High Risk Use; Acknowledgment and Waiver

4.1. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, you are not licensed to, and
you agree not to, use, copy, sell, offer for sale, or distribute the SDK or RECO
Beacon Devices (whether compiled with, incorporated into, or packaged with your
Application or otherwise), for or in connection with uses where failure
or fault of the RECO Beacon Device, RECO Beacon Redistributables or your
Application could lead to death or serious bodily injury of any person, or to
severe physical or environmental damage (“High Risk Use”). ANY SUCH USE IS
STRICTLY PROHIBITED. 

4.2. You acknowledge the SDK may allow you to develop Applications that enable
the control of motorized or mechanical equipment, or other systems, machines or
devices. If you elect to use the SDK in such a way, you must take steps to
design and test your Applications to ensure that your Applications do not
present risks of personal injury or death, property damage, or other losses. The
RECO Beacon Device, the RECO Beacon Redistributables and other software in the
SDK may not always function as intended. You must design your Applications so
that any failure of a RECO Beacon Device, a RECO Beacon Redistributable and/or
such other software does not cause personal injury or death, property damage, or
other losses. If you choose to use the SDK, (i) you assume all risk that use of
the RECO Beacon Device and/or such other software by you or by any others causes
any harm or loss, including to the end users of your Applications or to third
parties, (ii) you hereby waive, on behalf of yourself and your Authorized Users,
all claims against Perples and its affiliates related to such use, harm or
loss (including, but not limited to, any claim that a RECO Beacon Device, a
RECO Beacon Redistributable or such other software is defective),
and (iii) you agree to hold Perples and its affiliates harmless from such
claims.

5. Confidentiality and Privacy

5.1. Beta Software etc. Obligations. You acknowledge and agree that Perples may
share alpha or beta software or hardware with you that it identifies as
non-public. If so, you agree not to disclose such software or hardware to others
without the prior written consent of Perples until the time, if any, it is made
public by Perples, and to use such software or hardware only for the purposes
expressly permitted by this Agreement.

6. Ownership and Feedback

6.1. Ownership. Perples agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from
you (or your licensors) under this Agreement in or to any of your Applications,
including any intellectual property rights which subsist in those
Applications. As between Perples and you, Perples owns all right, title and
interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the SDK and
the RECO Beacon Redistributables, other than any third party software or
materials incorporated in the SDK, and you agree not to contest Perples’s
ownership of any of the foregoing.

6.2. Feedback. You may (but are not required to) provide feedback, comments and
suggestions (collectively, “Feedback”) to Perples. You hereby grant to Perples a
non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, paid-up, transferable, sub-licensable,
worldwide license under all intellectual property rights covering such
Feedback to use, disclose and exploit all such Feedback for any purpose.

7. Your Obligations and Warranties

In addition to your other obligations under this Agreement, you warrant and agree that:

7.1. You will use the SDK only in accordance with all accompanying
documentation, in the manner expressly permitted by this Agreement, and your use
of the SDK, and the marketing, sales and distribution of your Application, will
be in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and all Republic of
Korea and local or foreign export and re-export restrictions applicable to the
technology and documentation provided under this Agreement (including privacy
and data security laws and regulations), and you will not develop any
Application which would commit or facilitate the commission of a crime, or other
tortious, unlawful, or illegal act.

8. Agreement and Development Program

We reserve the right to change this Agreement, the SDK or the Perples
development and licensing program at any time in our discretion. Perples may
require that you either accept and agree to the new terms of this Agreement, or,
if you do not agree to the new terms, cease or terminate your use of the
SDK. Your continued use of the SDK after changes to this Agreement take
effect will constitute your acceptance of the changes. If you do not
agree to a change, you must stop using the SDK and terminate this
Agreement. Any termination of this Agreement by you under this Section 8
(and only this Section 8) will not affect your right, subject to your
continued compliance with your obligations under this Agreement, to
continue to distribute versions of your Application created and first
distributed before termination, and will not affect the right of your
End Users to continue using such versions of your Application, both of
which rights will survive termination.

9. Term and Termination

9.1. Term. This Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you
or Perples as set out below.

9.2. Termination by You. If you want to terminate this Agreement, you may
terminate it by uninstalling and destroying all copies of the SDK that are in

9.3. Termination by Perples. Perples may at any time, terminate this Agreement
with you for any reason or for no reason in Perples’s sole discretion, including
as a result of non-compliance by you with the restrictions in Section 1.2 or
Section 2.2, or for other reasons.

9.4. Effect of Termination. Upon termination of this Agreement, all rights
granted to you under this Agreement will immediately terminate and you must
immediately cease all use and destroy all copies of the SDK in your and your
Authorized Users’ possession, custody or control, and, except as specifically
set out in Section 8, cease your distribution of Applications. Sections 1.2,
2.2, 5.1, 6, 9.4, and 10 - 13, and the Definitions exhibit, will survive
termination of this Agreement. Termination of this Agreement will not affect
the right of your End Users who have downloaded your Application prior to
termination to continue using it.

10. Indemnification.

You agree to indemnify, hold harmless and, at Perples’s option, defend Perples
and its affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
and representatives harmless from any and all judgments, awards,
settlements, liabilities, damages, costs, penalties, fines and other
expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by
them arising out of or relating to any third party claim (a) with respect to
your Application, including products liability, privacy, or intellectual
property infringement claims, or (b) based upon your negligence or willful
misconduct or any breach or alleged breach of your representations,
warranties, and covenants under this Agreement. In no event may you enter
into any settlement or like agreement with a third party that affects
